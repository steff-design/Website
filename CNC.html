									<h2>Division of responsibilities</h2>
									<p>We started with each of us coming up with few ideas and on the first meeting we decided on making a wine shelf. Each of us had also made a design for the mold but Guðjón came up with the design for grapes, which we ended up executing. Guðjón was in charge of design drawings, preparing toolpaths and record “feeds and speeds” for the wine shelf. Guðjón was also in charge of making the video. Sara was in charge of the project management, including writing the product description and  making a licence. Stefán was in charge of making the mold for the grapes in Fusion 360, as well as preparing toolpaths and roughing and finishing. All members worked together on milling the wine shelf at Fablab, along with writing a text for the common website.</p>
                                    
                                    <hr class="major" />
                                    <h2>Project management</h2>
                                    
                                    <p>After deciding on a design, the project planning began. We decided to book a time at Fablab on the 10th of April, which gave us a push-start. After the milling we had 11 days left before submitting the assignment. Below is the planner we followed.
</p>
                                    <span class="image main"><img src="photos/task.png" alt="" /></span>
                                    <p>
There were no major changes made during the project, except for tasks number 7 and 8 (“CNC milling for molding” and “Molding and casting”). Due to time constraints at Fablab we didn’t get to do the molding, but instead we 3D printed the grapes. Fortunately this did not affect the timeline. Below is a Gantt Chart made along with the project planner.</p>
                                    <span class="image main"><img src="photos/brainstorm.png" alt="" /></span>
                                    
                                    <p>Furthermore there were a few milestones that needed to be achieved before executing some of the tasks. Following are the specified milestones.
</p>
                                    <span class="image main"><img src="photos/milestones.png" alt="" /></span>
                                    <p>Overall the outcome was beyond what we expected and we are very pleased with the final outcome.</p>

									<h2>Wine shelf</h2>
									<p>Our final project was to design and make something large with CNC milling, After few hours of brainstorming we decided to make a wine shelf, since we all have a love for wine. The size of the wine shelf is 860x300x140 (mm) and is made with plywood. What makes our design unique are the grapes in the middle of the rack, together with the "RED" and "WHITE" engravings. In the next project we were supposed to create a mold for the grapes but due to lack of time we had to 3D print the design, which came out well. The grapes are fastened to the shelf with a cylinder which goes through a 14mm hole that was milled.</p>

									<h2>Steps</h2>
									<p>The creation of the cnc milled project follows the majority of the steps found in the laser cutting project. The process does however allow for interesting effects stemming from the drillbit used at the expense of various limitations. Most immediate limitation is the shear size of the main drill bit used. <br>The procedure of making the project is: 

</p>
                                    <ol>
													<li>Make the intended project.</li>
												    <li>Nest it all to a 2D plane.</li>
												    <li>Make a sketch or a project that includes every piece and export it as an STL file.</li>
                                                    <li>Open the STL file in VCurve.</li>
                                                    <li>Make sure that the build has a set path that encompases the build.</li>
                                                    <li>Separate paths into separate routes for every drill bit you will use.</li>
                                                    <li>Add Dogbones/T-bones to every internal 90° corner where a separate part will slot in.</li>
                                        <span class="image main"><img src="photos/tbone.png" alt="" /></span>
                                                    <li>Set a drill bit preset for all paths.</li>
                                                    <li>Add taps for every piece in the project and optionally add tabs for anything that will be cut loose.</li>
                                                    <li>Place your preferred material in the milling machine and secure it via screws or hand clamps.</li>
                                                    <li>Secure the right drill bit in the machine using the right collet.</li>
                                                    <li>Set the X and Y coordinates to zero at your ideal location.</li>
                                                    <li>Run the Z coordinate setup using the machine preferred method.</li>
                                                    <li>Choose the RPM of the drill and the Z drop length.</li>
                                                    <li>Run the path file for the correct drill bit.</li>
                                                    <li>Repeat steps 11 to 15 for every drill bit you will be using for the project.</li>
                                                    <li>After the machine is finished flip the plate over and break the tabs; chisels and hammer are recommended.</li>
                                        <span class="image main"><img src="photos/cncmilling.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
                                                    <li>Chisels, rasps, saws and sandpaper can be used to remove the tab remnants and smooth the edges of the parts. Note that misuse of the tools can damage the project if used aggressively and going against the grain structure of the material.</li>
                                                    <li>Hammer the pieces in to their respective places and assemble the parts.</li>
                                                    <li>Enjoy the fruits of your labor.</li>

									<h2>Things to note</h2>
									<p>Due to the size of the main drill bit you need to make what are called dogbones or T-bones. This will compensate for the size of the drill bit when you need 90° corners but the drill won't allow it. A crucial factor to consider is that the drill bit is not exactly subtle. Going too fast, the wrong RPM, the chip size and depth per run, all these factors balance time versus quality. Material will be a large factor but if it's plywood like we used you will notice that it will rip out more material then you want. When smoothing it was important to go with the grain as it will tear out slivers of material if you go against it. 
                                </p>
                                    <p>Our project was a wine shelf. Origin inspiration was a shelf made from an <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Pallet-Wine-Rack/?fbclid=IwAR37Eox3hzGiM9LIlI8Sv18sWVKlS9THYaN7Mzr_hbjyDfHqIadw9jcG0HU">old wooden pallet</a><br>
                                    Taking the idea and refining it while adding in something only the cnc mill can do. The lettering turned out beautiful, despite minor issues. The fits were quite snug and needed a lot of sanding and work. Using a hand dremel, rasps and sandpaper the project came together nicely and it even had an insert in the front to allow for the next project (which was later 3D printed).
