										<h2>Step 1 - Getting Started</h2>
									</header>
									<p>This assignment was about making a functional website that is accessable to everyone. Having no previous experince in html coding I started by watching the pre-recorded videos our teacher had made for us, downloading Brackets and finding the template <a href="https://html5up.net/forty">Forty</a> that I found interesting on <a href="https://html5up.net/">html5.net</a>
                                    
                             </p>

												<h3>Step 2 - Coding in Brackets</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Brackets is a free open source code editor which focuses on web development. It's developed by Adobe Systems and was released 4th November 2014. It is written in JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Brackets is cross-platform, available for macOS, Windows, and most Linux distributions. 
                                            <br><br>
                                                After downloading the template I wanted to work with I started thinking about how I wanted the site to be designed. Knowing that we will have six assignments this semester I made a different link to each assignment which will be updated as we progress through the semester.
                                              <br>  For this assignment only three sites are needed. One "index" site which is the so called front page for my website. The second one is for the site you are viewing and reading at the moment. The third will be a temporary page that the next five assignments will be linked to, showing that they are in progress.<br><br> In the photo below you can see how "Step One - Getting Started" was coded.

												<h3>Step 3 - Github</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Millions of developers and companies build, ship, and maintain their software on GitHub—the largest and most advanced development platform in the world. <br><br>GitHub, Inc. is a provider of Internet hosting for software development and version control using Git. It offers the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git, plus its own features. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, continuous integration and wikis for every project.
                                                
                                                <br><br> Github makes it possible for me to share my website and makes it accessable to everyone. I started by creating a repository on the Github. Then I cloned the repository on Github Desktop and transfered the Brackets files into the repository on my desktop (which mirrors the one online). The next step is commiting to master, then pushing origin. The last thing I needed to do was selecting the branch as master and file it as \(root) in the settings online.
Commit to master.
Push Origin.
On the Github website go to your repository.
Go to settings. Scroll down till you see Github Pages. Select Brancch as master and file as /(root).
Press save.
You should now have a link to your working website.

												<h3>Step 4 - Finishing touches</h3>
											</header>
											<p>After having done all of the above I noticed some flaws with my design and coding so I went back to the coding to perfect my assignment as much as I could. To make the changes final on my website I had to repeat the steps above.
